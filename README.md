# Breaking-Captcha-using-CNN
Implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model for recognizing text-based CAPTCHAs. It provides a framework for training and evaluating the model on various captcha datasets.

# Key Features:

CNN Architecture: Utilizes a well-structured CNN architecture optimized for captcha recognition.
Data Preprocessing: Includes techniques to prepare captcha images for effective training, such as noise reduction, normalization, and segmentation (if necessary).
Training Script: Provides a script to train the CNN model on your chosen captcha dataset.
Evaluation Script: Offers a script to evaluate the model's performance on a hold-out validation set or a separate test set.
Ethical Considerations: Discusses the potential misuse of captcha-breaking techniques and emphasizes responsible use (e.g., accessibility tools for visually impaired users).

The effectiveness of the model may vary depending on the complexity and variety of CAPTCHAs it encounters. Consider techniques like data augmentation or transfer learning to improve robustness.
